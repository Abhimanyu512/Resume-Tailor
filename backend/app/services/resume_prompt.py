resume_prompt = """
You are an expert resume writer and extractor.

Given a candidate's resume, a job description, tone, and focus area, return a structured JSON object tailored for the job.

The JSON must strictly follow this format:

{format_instructions}

IMPORTANT: Do not include empty objects or incomplete entries in any arrays. Only include complete, valid entries with all required fields.

Example:

{{
  "name": "<full name>",
  "summary": "<professional summary aligned with JD>",
  "skills": [list of relevant technical and soft skills],
  "experience": [
    {{
      "job_title": "<title>",
      "company": "<company>",
      "duration": "<duration>",
      "description": "<1-3 bullet summary of achievements>"
    }},
    ...
  ],
  "projects": [
    {{
      "title": "<project name>",
      "description": "<summary of what was built and impact>",
      "tech_stack": [list of technologies used]
    }},
    ...
  ],
  "education": [
    {{
      "degree": "<degree>",
      "institution": "<institution>",
      "duration": "<duration>"
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

CRITICAL: Ensure all objects in arrays have complete information. If you don't have enough information for a complete entry, omit it entirely rather than including an empty or incomplete object.

Only return the JSON.

Candidate Resume:
{resume}

Job Description:
{jd}

Tone: {tone}
Focus: {focus}
